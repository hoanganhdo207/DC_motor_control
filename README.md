# ⚙️ DC Motor Control with PID – Speed and Position
This project demonstrates how to control a DC motor's speed and position using the PID control algorithm. By continuously adjusting the motor's input based on feedback from a encoder sensor, the system can maintain precise speed and move to target positions with high accuracy.

## 🔧 Key Features
  - Real-time speed control using PID
  - Position control through incremental encoder feedback
  - Configurable PID parameters for tuning and system response optimization
## 🧠 System design
